# Contributing

Arrakis is open to contributors.

One simple way to contribute is to simply [open an
issue](https://gitlab.com/valoranM/arrakis/-/issues).

Stuff that are currently planned can be looked at in [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md).

If you wish to contribute code, please keep in mind that Arrakis is distributed
under the [`CeCILL 2.1 license`](./LICENSE), and that any code submitted will be
redistributed under this same license.

You must own full right to any code submitted.
It is recommanded to [sign any code submitted with a GPG key](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/signed_commits/gpg.html)

Submitted code must also respect the following coding style:
* Wrap line at 80 characters
* Use snake_case
* Use space instead of tabulation
* Remove any trailing whitespace
